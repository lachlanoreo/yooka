  <p>Sometimes you just need to speak to someone.
  Thatâ€™s OK, we all have times where we just dont feel right!
  When you feel this way its best to speak to someone you trust.
  You can reach out to your teacher, someone close to you or services that have friendly
  people waiting for you. <br><br>
  What would you prefer?</p>
